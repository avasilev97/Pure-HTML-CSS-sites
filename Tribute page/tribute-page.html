    <h2>Here's a summary of Jim Key's abilities and contributions to society:</h2>
    <div class="list">
    <ul>
      <li>The world's most educated horse was Jim Key, born in 1889, he could count to thirty, could add and subtract, move the hands of a clock to tell the correct time, knew the alphabet, and would select letters from his special board to spell words and common names.  He once beat sixth graders in a spelling contest as he was the only one who could correctly spell words like "constitution" "physics" and the name "Issac."</li>
      <li>He could answer yes or no to questions, would express political opinions -- and insisted he was a democrat -- even when meeting Republican Presidents. </li>
      <li>Jim could write his first name on a chalk board, but didn't much like the taste of chalk, so preferred to place his letters on his special board.</li>
      <li>Jim Key was mahogany bay, a deep brown, with a black mane and very long black tail which reached almost to the ground.  He was a large Arabian-Hambletonian mix at 16 hands. Jim Key loved to delight audiences and was an amazing comedic performer who demonstrated inexplicable improvised feats.  </li>
      <li>During one performance when President Roosevelt's daughter, Alice was in the audience, he "predicted" her future fiance by spelling out her entire married name, even though at the time Alice wasn't even engaged to the gentleman. </li>
      <li>Jim Key dazzled and amazed an estimated 10 million people who came to see him at the world's fairs and exhibitions.  And just as impressive was his person, Doc Key who taught him everything.</li>
      <li>Jim Key starting learning through imitation.  As a still crippled colt, he would watch  Doc Key's dog and soon could do all the tricks the dog could do. This showed Doc he was no ordinary horse.  Using teaching methods of kindness, patience, and persistence, Doc Key realized he had a star on his hands.</li>
      <li>For the first few years, the Doc had a medicine show where he would present Jim Key as he sold his “miracle cure” liniment which worked on people as well as animals.  </li>
      <li>When people saw the horse perform, they would try to bid hundreds of dollars to buy him. As soon as The Doc pronounced, “Sold!” Jim would put on a display of illness and lameness, and appeared to be at death’s door.  The sale was immediately canceled!  Then Doc would treat him with Keystone liniment and the horse would immediately spring back to life.</li>
      <li>Doc Key and Jim key had their own customized railroad car for travelling, and a Broadway show in New York City called The Scholar and the Model Office Boy and regularly received standing ovations.  The consummate performer, Jim Key would "ham it up" even more for appreciative audiences, and would often pick one woman in the audience with whom to flirt, smiling, swishing his tail and prancing for just her.  </li>
      <li>Many famous guests came to see him, including Booker T. Washington, composer John Philip Sousa, William Taft and President Mckinley.  Jim Key would correctly answer questions from the audience and perform amazing feats of intelligence.  </li>
      <li>There were many accusations of it all being a hoax, but no one was ever able to prove that. Doc Key invited a team of Harvard professors to test the horse.  They tested him for hours without the Doc being present and couldn’t find any evidence of the horse being cued -- as a horse named Clever Hans had inadvertently been.  They announced their conclusions, that Jim Key was highly educated.  </li>
      <li>To further prove Jim Key really thought out his own answers, Doc Key was happy to have reporters test Jim Key without him being present, but asked them to have an apple in their pocket. </li>
      <li>One reporter, who was at first convinced that the horse was hypnotized by the doctor, came and interviewed Jim Key.  The horse spelled out all the correct answers with his letter board, and the reporter exited without giving Jim Key the apple he was expecting. </li>
      <li>The reporter left a believer, but when Doc Key asked his horse how it went, Jim Key spelled out the word “fruitless.”  </li>
      <li>A portion of the proceeds of Jim Key's shows went to the nascent Humane Societies.  Jim Key was changing the current perception about animals.  It was undeniable that Jim Key was a sentient being.  He was an ambassador for not only horse intelligence but provided living proof of an animal’s potential inner life and the need to treat animals humanely. </li>
      </ul>
